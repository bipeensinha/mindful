मैं दुर्गेश मिश्रा, मिर्ज़ापुर (उत्तर प्रदेश) से हूँ। यह वीडियो मुझे बहुत शांति देने वाला लगा। पिछले कुछ समय से स्वास्थ्य को लेकर परेशान हूँ। आपसे विनम्र अनुरोध है कि मेरे स्वास्थ्य के लिए रेकी हीलिंग भेजें। धन्यवाद, आपकी ऊर्जा बहुत सुकून देती है।


I love how simplicity is explained here — not as a goal, but as a natural outcome of mindful thinking.

This really made me pause and reflect. Sometimes we complicate life unnecessarily.

Beautiful message 🤍 Less striving, more meaning.

Such a powerful thought. Good ideas don’t need noise — they speak quietly and last longer.

This resonates deeply. Modest expectations truly bring freedom and mental peace.

Exactly what I needed to read today. Simplicity feels like healing.

Mindfulness teaches this so gently — clarity first, simplicity follows.

Calm visuals, calm words, calm energy. Thank you for sharing such mindful content.
